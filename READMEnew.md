Updating Scene Switch
	Currently, whenever there's a scene change it creates a brand new window and doesn't close the previous one. I want to add a class that keeps everything on the same window but still switches scenes

Cleanup Crew
	Organizing all the different classes for each of the functions is important for updating the code. Some don't need their own scripts and can be combined with others. This helps alleviate project size and make everything more efficient.  Additionally, I'm going to have the items or the food that you have be readable from a file. So this way you can create new food types just by providing images maybe a key and a location or whatever other properties are needed. This would allow it to be more flexible and also would clean up some of the hard coding in 

Better UI
	There's not good way to say this, but the UI and design of everything just looks like trash. The stat counter in the corner is awful, the levels are not consistent with the menus, we didn't add the animation we promised, and the food items/tutorial hurt to look at. Improving everything would simply make the whole game better.
